# EHRI PID Tools

This is an embryonic set of tools for working with Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) in the EHRI project.

At present, it consists of a proxy for the DataCite REST API and a registration service to enable
the registration of DOIs for EHRI resources and the display of DOI landing pages.

Almost nothing is finished yet though.
